<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This README document is designed to help the viewer understand the structure of the overall repository. The tool contains files related to the playbook management tool used to input/edit/query the mediawiki with new information. The `readme-images` folder simply contains any image files that are used in the many readme files of the project. 
The playbook management tool is designed to provide a wide variety of functionalities around cyber security playbooks. Such as playbook creation, management, limited automatic execution and easy sharing. However, the open-source version does not contain all the functionalities.

### Disclaimer
This is a proof-of-concept prototype and is not suitable for production use. The code has not been thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities. For further information and support regarding production use, commercial applications, and advanced features, please contact the DPS group at Fraunhofer FIT: https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/en/business-areas/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/data-protection-and-sovereignty.html

## Dependencies
As a scientific library in the Python ecosystem, we rely on external libraries to offer our features. In the `/third_party` folder, we list all the licenses of our direct dependencies. Please check the `/third_party/licenses.json` file to get a full list of dependencies and the corresponding licenses.

### Basic Technologies
- You need to download and install Semantic Mediawiki (SMW) instance. For that, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and then install the [SMW](https://github.com/WolfgangFahl/pymediawikidocker?tab=readme-ov-file/).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/), v3.10.13 was used for the development. Anything later *should* work fine too. Previous versions may work but are not tested. Python 2 is not supported.
### Python Packages
All the required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. They can be installed using the following command:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
This section concerns the creation of a Semantic Media Wiki instance which is a prerequisite for SASP. If you are updating from a previous version or connecting to an existing instance, you can skip this section.

**This section is under development. We will provide an automated script to install a dockerized version of SMW.**

You need to download and install SMW instance. For that, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and then install the [SMW](https://github.com/WolfgangFahl/pymediawikidocker?tab=readme-ov-file/).

### Run Program
In order for SASP to work, the mediawiki setup must have been fully completed and the Mediawiki must be active. After the setup procedure is done, make sure the docker containers are running and then proceed with the installation of the tool. The tool is being developed using Python 3.10.13 and Django 4.1 and should be compatible with Python 3.10 and above. The tool is currently being developed on Windows 10, but should be compatible with Linux and MacOS as well.

### Prerequisites and Installation

Make sure all the dependencies listed above are installed. 

### Configuration

The project uses a `config.env` and `keys.env` to store configuration and sensitive information. 
In the `/config/` folder, there is a `config_example.env` and `keys_example.env` file that can be used as a template for the actual `config.env` and `keys.env` files and below is an overview of the environment variables used in the project and installation.

### Automatic Setup
1.  Install all the prerequisites from the previous chapter
2.  Make sure the mediawiki is running and the connection information is correct in the `config/config.env` file.
3.  Execute the following commands
```sh
python setup.py
```

### Manual Setup
1. Install all the prerequisites from the previous chapter
2. Make sure the mediawiki is running and the connection information is correct in the `config/config.env` file.
4. Execute the following commands
```sh
# Creates the database
python manage.py migrate
# Creates the default user with the configuration information from the `*.env` files
python manage.py make_default_user
# Compiles the forms and pushes them to the wiki
python manage.py update_forms
```

### Updating the Tool
Unless otherwise instructed you only need to update the database and the default user, so use the provided switches in the `setup.py` script to skip the form update and playbook import steps.

### Running the Program
Assuming everything is set up correctly, you can run the program with the following steps:
1. Run SASP from the terminal/powershell while in the project's folder
   ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```  
    You can also specify address and port to run the server on. For example:
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```
7. Open the browser and navigate to the URL that is printed in the terminal/powershell. By default this is `http://localhost:8000/sasp/`

### Additional Commands
There are a few additional commands that can be used to interact with the tool all are invoked with `python manage.py <command>`. 
- `import_playbook`: Imports a playbook from a json file into the tool
  - `--path`: Path to the json file (Required)
- `make_default_user`: Creates a default user with the configuration information from the `*.env` files or overwrites the existing one
- `createsuperuser`: Django command to create a superuser. With this user you can access the admin interface of the tool at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and manage the database

## Roadmap
This section shows a **very** general overview of the tasks that have been completed and other features that have yet to have been implemented.
 - [ ] Clean up repository structure, update documentation
 - [ ] Implement semantic functionality for the tool and remove the mediawiki dependency
